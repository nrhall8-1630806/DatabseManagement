# Breakdown of my pieces of work and what abilities they demonstrate
This repository is set up in order to demonstrate my knowledge of SQL and ability to create and adjust databases and execute certain queries.


Demonstration 1: Creating a relational database with tables that are interconnected with foreign and primary keys and create views for these tables. <br />
Demonstration 2: Completing simple requests made by requestor to select certain pieces of data from the database. <br />
Demonstration 3: Processing data from the data base per request from a requestor. <br />
Demonstration 4: Creating a database with tables, permissions and views and creating stored procedures for users to pull from and edit the databases content. <br />
Demonstration 5: Designing and creating a database with tables, constraints, views and stored procedures and making permissions so that the database is not altered by the wrong individuals.

## File: SQL Project
This project was made to display my ablities to create a relational database for a healthcare platform and create BI reports of the data in the database.

Milestone 1: Creating a plan for the layout of the database, the relationships between the tables and the characteristics of the attributes in the tables. <br />
Milestone 2: Creating the full relational database for the platform with all tables, constraints, views, stored procedures and permissions. <br />
Milestone 3: Finalizing the database and all of its componenets and importing data into the database. Then creating BI reports to analyze the data in the database.
